## 📊 Sample Queries

Try these example queries in the dashboard's SQL interface:

### Team Roster and Player Information

```sql
-- Dallas Mavericks roster with jersey numbers and positions
SELECT p.full_name, t.full_name AS team_name, cpi.jersey, cpi.position
FROM nba.player p
JOIN nba.common_player_info cpi ON p.player_id = cpi.person_id
JOIN nba.team t ON cpi.team_id = t.team_id
WHERE t.full_name = 'Dallas Mavericks'
ORDER BY p.full_name;
```

### Team Win Percentages (Simplified)

```sql
-- Team win percentages - optimized query
SELECT 
  t.full_name AS team,
  COUNT(g.game_id) AS games,
  SUM(CASE WHEN g.wl_home = 'W' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
  ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN g.wl_home = 'W' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::decimal / COUNT(g.game_id)) * 100, 1) AS win_percentage
FROM nba.game g
JOIN nba.team t ON g.team_id_home = t.team_id
GROUP BY t.full_name
ORDER BY win_percentage DESC;
```

### Player Draft Analysis

```sql
-- Basic player information with physical attributes
SELECT 
  p.full_name,
  p.player_id,
  t.full_name AS team_name,
  cpi.jersey, 
  cpi.position,
  cpi.height,
  cpi.weight,
  cpi.country
FROM nba.player p
JOIN nba.common_player_info cpi ON p.player_id = cpi.person_id
JOIN nba.team t ON cpi.team_id = t.team_id
ORDER BY p.full_name
LIMIT 20;
```

### Game Points Analysis

```sql
-- Game points analysis with margin of victory
SELECT 
  g.game_date,
  th.full_name AS home_team,
  tv.full_name AS visitor_team,
  g.pts_home,
  g.pts_away,
  g.pts_home - g.pts_away AS point_differential,
  CASE WHEN g.pts_home > g.pts_away THEN th.full_name ELSE tv.full_name END AS winner
FROM nba.game g
JOIN nba.team th ON g.team_id_home = th.team_id
JOIN nba.team tv ON g.team_id_away = tv.team_id
ORDER BY g.game_date DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### Exploring Available Player Information

```sql
-- Check available columns in player information table
SELECT *
FROM nba.common_player_info
LIMIT 5;
```
```

### Luka Doncic Performance Analysis

```sql
-- Luka Doncic performance analysis with advanced metrics
SELECT 
  p.full_name,
  t.full_name AS team_name,
  cpi.jersey,
  cpi.position,
  cpi.height,
  cpi.weight,
  cpi.country
FROM nba.player p
JOIN nba.common_player_info cpi ON p.player_id = cpi.person_id
JOIN nba.team t ON cpi.team_id = t.team_id
WHERE p.full_name LIKE '%Doncic%';
```
